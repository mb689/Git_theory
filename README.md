## What is version control
- Version control is a system that helps manage changes to a project's source code or files over time, allowing multiple people to work on the same files and track changes made by each person.

It involves creating and maintaining a repository (which can be a centralized server or a distributed system) that contains all the versions of the files in the project. Each version of the file is saved as a snapshot, and the repository keeps a record of all changes made to the files.

## What is git
- Git, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, is a distributed version control system used by developers worldwide. It enables collaborative work as every developer has their own copy of the entire repository, including its full history, and allows easy sharing of changes. Git provides features such as branching and merging, enabling developers to work on different features or experiments in separate "branches" and then "merge" them back into the main codebase. Git can handle conflicts when multiple developers make changes to the same file at the same time, enabling easy conflict resolution. Its popularity has led to the development of many third-party tools and integrations that make it even more useful in various software development workflows.
